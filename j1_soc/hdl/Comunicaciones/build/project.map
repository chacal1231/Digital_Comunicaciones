      Number using O5 output only:              22
      Number using O5 and O6:                  202
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,200    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      6
      Number with same-slice register load:      4
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   147 out of     600   24%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       188 out of   1,200   15%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          444
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           241 out of     444   54%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   6 out of     444    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         197 out of     444   44%
    Number of unique control sets:              12
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              43 out of   4,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
