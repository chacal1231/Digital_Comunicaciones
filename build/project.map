      Number using O6 output only:             112
      Number using O5 output only:              17
      Number using O5 and O6:                  183
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,200    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      2
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   101 out of     600   16%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       156 out of   1,200   13%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          324
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           147 out of     324   45%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  10 out of     324    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         167 out of     324   51%
    Number of unique control sets:              14
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              48 out of   4,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
